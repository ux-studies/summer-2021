# task-5

Please remember to start and stop your sceen and audio recording for each task.

1. Create a deployment using the task-5/large deployment/guestbook folder. 
2. Once the deployment is running, view the logs for a single pod and write down the magic key found in the logs. 
3. Delete the deployment and wait until the task terminates.

Upload captured screen and audio recordings to the respective results/P# folder and name each recording after the task name and include your P#. For example, "P#-task-5" for the fifth task.
