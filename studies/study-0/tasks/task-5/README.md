# task-5 instructions

The goal of task-5 is to create a namespace, create the guestbook application in the namespace, view the logs for the _ pod, then delete the guestbook application:

1. Create a namespace to house the guestbook application.
2. Create the guestbook application in that namespace.
3. Wait until all the deployments are running.
4. View the logs for a single pod and write down the random string "magic key: XXXXXXX" found in the logs.
5. Delete the guestbook application and wait until the task terminates.
