# task-2

Please remember to start and stop your sceen and audio recording for each task.

1. apply_pod: Create a pod using the scenarios/P0/pod/pod.yaml file. 
2. Once the pod is running, view the logs for the pod and write down the magic key found in the logs. 
3. Delete the pod and wait until the task terminates. 

Upload captured screen and audio recordings to the respective "results/P#" folder and name each recording after the task name and include your P#. For example, "P#-task-1" for the first task.
