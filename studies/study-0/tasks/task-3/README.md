# task-3

Please remember to start and stop your sceen and audio recording for each task.

1. Create a deployment using the task-3/small deployment/bunch folder. 
2. Once the deployment is running, delete the deployment and wait until the task terminates. 

Upload captured screen and audio recordings to the respective results/P# folder and name each recording after the task name and include your P#. For example, "P#-task-3" for the third task.
