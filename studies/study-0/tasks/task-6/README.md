# task-6 instructions

The goal of task-6 is to create a namespace, create the guestbook application in the namespace, search all the logs for each deployment, then delete the guestbook application and the namespace:

1. Create a namespace to house the guestbook application.
2. Create the guestbook application in that namespace.
3. Wait until all the deployments are running.
4. There are six pods in total. Search all the logs to find the names of the pods that have the random string "magic key is #######" in their logs. 
5. Delete the guestbook application and wait until the task terminates.
6. Delete the namespace and wait until the task temrinates.
