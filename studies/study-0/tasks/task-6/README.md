# task-6

Please remember to start and stop your sceen and audio recording for each task.

1. Create a deployment using the task-6/large deployment/guestbook folder. 
2. Once all the deployments are running, view the logs for every pod and write down each magic key found in the logs. 
3. Delete the deployments and wait until the task terminates.

Upload captured screen and audio recordings to the respective results/P# folder and name each recording after the task name and include your P#. For example, "P#-task-6" for the sixth task.
