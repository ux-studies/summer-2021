# task-6 instructions

This task repeats the steps completed in task-5 and builds on them. The goal of task-6 is to create a namespace, create the guestbook application in the namespace, search all the logs for each deployment, then delete the guestbook application and the namespace:

1. Create a namespace to house the guestbook application.
2. Create the guestbook application in that namespace.
3. Wait until all the deployments are running.
4. Search all the logs to find the names of the pods that have the random string "magic key: #######" in their logs.
5. Delete the guestbook application and wait until the task terminates.
