# task-4 instructions

This task repeats the steps completed in task-3 and builds on them. The goal of task-4 is to create an application, view the logs of a pod, then delete the application:

1. Create the bunch application. 
2. Once the _ deployment is running, view the logs for a single pod and write down the random string "magic key: XXXXXXX" found in the logs. 
3. Delete the bunch application and wait until the task terminates.
